## Background {.smaller}
-   During an outbreak attention is often focused on urban areas
    + Often greater surveillance/infrastructure
    + Place first noticed
    + Potential for explosive growth (greater density and contact)
    
-   However, given the chance, even those that start/take off in urban areas will spread to rural and micropolitan areas
    + West African Ebola Outbreak
    + COVID-19

Do we have granular enough data for non-urban areas?

## Background {.smaller}
-   With a few exceptions (generally large urban areas) most disease surveillance in U.S. goes no lower than county level.
-   We know that county-level data fails to capture the full story in large metropolitan areas, but what about more rural areas?

## Broad research questions {.smaller}
1. Does within county heterogeneity exist in COVID-19 burden?
2. Characterize COVID-19 burden and severity across spectrum of rurality/urbanicity and how this is modified by community-level factors.


## Broad research questions {.smaller}
1. **Does within county heterogeneity exist in COVID-19 burden?**
2. Characterize COVID-19 burden and severity across spectrum of rurality/urbanicity and how this is modified by community-level factors.

What do we expect to find?

-   No apparent heterogeneity within micropolitan and rural counties
-   Consistent heterogeneity within micropolitan and rural counties
-   Inconsistent heterogeneity within micropolitan and rural counties


## Data {.smaller}
-   To try and answer this question we're using data from the COVID Neighborhood Project (CONEP).
    + A data collection effort to bring fine-scale, spatially-referenced data on COVID-19 together with data from the National Neighborhood Data Archive (NaNDA).
    + Currently have data from 21 states: 5 at Census tract level and 16 at Zip code level

![](figures/conep.png)

## Methods {.smaller}
-   We will focus on the 5 states with Census Tract data as tracts are nested within counties.
    + **Wisconsin**, **New Mexico**, Louisiana, Delaware, Rhode Island
-   Will fit generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs)
    + With a random effect for county only
    + With random effects for county and tract
    + Both models also include RUCA, calendar month, and cases from prior month
-   Can then do a modified likelihood ratio test of the models to assess whether the random effect for tract is needed to account for within county heterogeneity
    + Modified because under the $H_0$ that a given variance component equals 0, the test statistic follows a mixture of chi-square distributions.
    + Also fit stratified models (metropolitan, micropolitan, and rural) to assess how this may vary by rurality.

# Results

## Wisconsin - Overall model {.smaller}
-   The overall model with random effects for both county *and* tract fit better than the model with only a random effect for county.
    + Modified LRT (p < 0.0001)

## Wisconsin - Stratified models {.smaller}
-   Only the metropolitan model (RUCA = 1-3) showed meaningful within county variance.
    + Based on modified LRT (p < 0.0001)

## New Mexico - Overall model {.smaller}
-   The overall model with random effects for both county *and* tract fit better than the model with only a random effect for county.

## New Mexico - Stratified models {.smaller}
-   Both the metropolitan model (RUCA = 1-3) and the rural model (RUCA = 7-10) showed meaningful within county variance.
    + Modified LRT in both cases p < 0.0001

## Conclusions {.smaller}
-   There is within county variability in non-metro areas, but it's not consistent.
    + Need to explore what contributes to the whether this within-county heterogeneity exists in rural and micropolitan communities.
-   Need to assess how meaningful this is for forecasting.

## Next steps {.smaller}

**Short Term**

-   Process other state data and run models to assess within county variance.
-   Assess whether this within county variance has a meaningful impact on forecasting.
-   Characterize burden/severity of COVID-19 across spectrum of rurality and impact of community-level factors
:::

::: {.column width=50%}

**Longer Term**

-   Explore feeding data into model(s) used as part of CDC ensemble forecast
-   Explore Bayesian approach that allows correlation structure to vary
    + To my knowledge not currently possible from frequentist approach in R
-   How robust are our findings to other measures of rurality/urbanicity?
